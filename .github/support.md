# Instructions for discussion topics

Please propose topics for breakout discussions during the workshop. We have set aside 4 slots for such discussions where small groups can brainstorm ideas and report back to everyone.

When listing a topic, please provide a short summary to help other participants understand the issue, and if possible, link to any resources on the web.
