Dear URSSI workshop participants,   
We are looking forward to meeting everyone on Tuesday. Here are a few updates:

* We have added more details on the location of the meeting on the GitHub repo (https://github.com/si2-urssi/berkeley_workshop) and also updated the agenda (https://github.com/si2-urssi/berkeley_workshop/blob/master/agenda.md)
* Before the first breakout session, please sign at https://uconfly.org/urssi1/ using your Google account (or create a new account here). This will allow you to create Google docs to capture notes from your discussion group and make all notes accessible in a single location. For now all you'll have to do is sign up and we'll provide more instructions on Tuesday.
* If you haven't joined our Slack group yet, please do so here: https://urssi-slack.herokuapp.com/
* Bernie Boscoe has started a thread for participants to coordinate rides to the venue/airport: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UgJDJuYhEcBkK0XQc-rnzzah_lNFcu4KqQIiSuTSCkE/edit

thanks,
- Karthik
